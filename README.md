Gem to enable easy title casing of strings containing Unicode text.

## Introduction
This gem patches the String class to provide a unicode_titlecase method, which returns a string that is 'title cased': the first letter in each significant word is in capitals with the rest in lowercase.

## Features
* handles text containing Unicode characters
* handles words that should always be left capitalised (e.g., 'HIV')
* handles words that should always be left in lower case (e.g., 'to')

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'unicode_titlecase'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install unicode_titlecase

## Usage


To use, just call the unicode_titlecase method on any string you want to titlecase.

For example,

    require 'unicode_titlecase'

    s = "the rain in spain stays mainly in the plain"
    puts s.unicode_titlecase

gives

    "The Rain in Spain Stays Mainly in the Plain"

More examples are set out in the YAML files in the /spec/examples directory.

## Unicode Text

The headline feature of this gem is easy title casing of Unicode text.

For example,

	"W Hiszpanii mży, gdy dżdżyste przyjdą dni".unicode_titlecase

gives

	"W Hiszpanii Mży, Gdy Dżdżyste Przyjdą Dni"

More examples [here](https://github.com/cantab/unicode_titlecase/blob/master/spec/examples/unicode_examples.yaml).

## 'Big Words'

In some circumstances, you may have source text that contains words that should remain capitalised. These include Roman numerals ('VIII'), legal entity designations ('SA', 'AB', 'LLC') or technical abbreviations ('RNA', DNA', 'HIV').

The unicode_titlecase gem allows you to set up a list of 'big words' which it will keep upper-cased.

	"DNA vs RNA - difference and comparison".unicode_titlecase

produces

	"DNA vs RNA - Difference and Comparison"

More examples [here](https://github.com/cantab/unicode_titlecase/blob/master/spec/examples/bigword_examples.yaml).

## 'Small Words'

Similarly, you source text may contain words that should always be in lower case.

For example, in English, a number of short words such as 'is', 'of' and 'by' might be considered to look better in title cased text if they remain in lower case.

So

	'a government by the people for the people'.unicode_titlecase

will give

	'A Government by the People for the People'

More examples [here](https://github.com/cantab/unicode_titlecase/blob/master/spec/examples/standard_examples.yaml).

## Troubleshooting

- [irb does not display Unicode] (https://github.com/cantab/unicode_titlecase/wiki/Displaying-Unicode-Text-in-irb)

## Sources and Acknowledgements

Much of the source is based on Sam Souder's 'titlecase' gem at [samsouder/titlecase] (http://github.com/samsouder/titlecase) which in turn is derived from the [rules] (http://daringfireball.net/2008/05/title_case) formulated by John Gruber.

#### Gruber's Rules
  - capitalize each word
  - downcase each of the small_words
  - words with capitals after the first character are left alone
  - words with periods are left alone
  - first and last word always capitalized
  - small words after colons are capitalized

#### titlecase gem by samsouder

  - implemented rules in Ruby
  - [Github repo] (http://github.com/samsouder/titlecase)
  - [Rubygems.org] (http://rubygems.org/gems/titlecase)

#### Others
  - Jim Nanney ([Github](https://github.com/jimnanney)) contributed to some of the code (go remote pairing!)

## Further Features?
Here's a list of things we'd like to see in a future version of the unicode_titlecase gem. Please feel free to take any of these on (see [Contributing] (http://github.com/cantab/unicode_titlecase#contributing) below).
  - handle strings with 'mixed case words' such as GmbH
  - place exceptions into separate files in e.g., YAML (instead of storing in local variables)
